YouTube-View-Predictor-ML

This project was an attempt to create a Multiple Variable Linear Regressiong
that predicts the views on a YouTube video give the Likes, Dislikes, and Comments

Data was taken from over 600 YouTube channels to train the model.
This project was partially successful.

It can predict the views but not as accurately as I'd like.
With a range to cover 2Ïƒ (95% coverage) the actual views is always near the lower bound

Things to think on:
- Use more data, such as subscriber count and number of videos on channel
- Generalizing all videos on YouTube is impossible, not all videos are equal
- Work better with more mainstream videos, such as the Trending section
